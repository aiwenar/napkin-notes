## SPARFA-based Algorithms

I made some minor tweaks
to the SPARFA-based algorithms,
mostly dealing with convergence
and the way they are called
by the `SPARFA Server` code.

## Biglearn Deployment

It sounds like Mike A.
has pretty much got the SPARFA-based calculation working.

I'm not currently up-to-date
on the status of the deployment scripts
(I've been largely on vacation the last few weeks).

## Performance Forecast UX

Alicia and Kevin Wu
are working on the UX
