So, yeah, that happened.

## Dev/Testing/Release Woes

I have been looking into possible solutions
to various problems we're seeing in these areas.

### AWS Aurora Postgres Support

We are currently using "vanilla" AWS RDS postgres,
which are AWS-maintained server instaces 
running postgres just like we do when running locally.

However, AWS RDS Aurora
is very close to providing postgres support
(it is currently in customer preview).
From our perspective,
this should like exactly like our current postgres servers,
but should have better performance
and, perhaps more importantly,
extremely fast copy-on-write cloning.
That should allow us to very quickly 
create production backups and production-like replicas for testing.

I have signed up for the preview mode
and will conduct tests as soon as my registration is processed,
which will hopefully be this week.
