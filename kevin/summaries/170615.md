## SPARFA-based Algorithms

I finished packaging
the SGD-based SPARFA algorithms
into a python distribution package.
I'll be handing it over to Mike A. today, hopefully.

There are a lot of decoy pages
in the python package area,
but here are some links
that I found useful during this process:
[this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#)
and
[this](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure)

## Biglearn Deployment

Most, if not all,
of the issues described last week
have been fixed
(because Dante is a machine).

There are some new areas
where we need to improve performance,
but I'm pretty sure this is doable.

I believe Amanda and Ryan
have been able to setup `Biglearn` environments
pretty routinely lately.
The only question mark in my mind
is the starting/restarting of background tasks.

Mike A. has pushed
[some code](https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server)
which I will start looking at
once he has verified
that he can use 
my python package.
