## AWS Aurora Postgres (preview mode)

I still need to discuss this with Dante.

## AWS Autoscaling

I was able to make a good-sized dent this week;
for whatever reason I've been pretty focused
and things are falling nicely into place.

I have scripted the process of:
* creating an instance
* fetching code from GitHub
* creating a daemon to run worker code

The CloudFormation template for this can be found
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-nj65ipk54lxq-us-east-1/2017264pJE-TestTemplatetzvib2v9pld).

This still leaves creating daemons _from_ the GitHub code,
but I'm optimistic that can be done using the same
[bag of tricks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmn2xYBURE90fiZrdNG5CN28vEBCPJbKukDTbUqntZ4/edit#).
