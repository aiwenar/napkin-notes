## BL API Autoscaling

I'm changing my tack on this.
Mainly because there are inevitable problems on the horizon 
that need to be solved 
before the API server can be built and delivered effectively.

There are two main things we need to deal with:
* single API server
  * code, test, deliver, deploy
  * zero downtime
    * need to measure "upness"
  * work kinks out of processes and create tooling for feature:
    * development
    * integration
    * QA
    * delivery
    * deployment
    * release
  * some goals:
    * if automated tests pass, it's deployable
    * non-dev humans only need to do exploratory testing
      * if issue is found, work with dev to create automated test
* multiple API servers
  * server-to-server contract testing
  * end-to-end integration
  * "synchronized" deliveries/deployments
  * setup for testing scenarios

Some immediate things I'm trying to do:
* validate that we can do a zero-downtime deployment
  * I've done this on a limited scale
    * system under load, so any downtime is detected
    * several issues/surprises, but rolling migration seemed to work
      * need to keep ASGs properly sized during deploy to avoid downtime
      * users will see blue/green versions of code during deployment
      * if healthchecks fail, automatic rollback
      * migrations can still break everything, so `staging` is our friend
    *  still need to work on tooling
 * validate zero-downtime migrations
   * need to put LOTS of data into db
     * initially, could potentially be done manually
   * need to check which operations are fast
     * under load (so non-locking)
   * need to work out how background updates work
     * also need to be fast under load
   * need to translate all that into rails/python migrations
     * there are some tools to automatically detect non-ZDT migrations
       * probably worth checking out

## Pretty Picture of the Week

This is still a work in progress,
but it covers the linkages between a bunch of things.
