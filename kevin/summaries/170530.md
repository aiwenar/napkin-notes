## Biglearn Deployment

QA testing of `BL`
was delayed from Tue to Thu
of last week.
Despite this,
we hit what seemed to be
non-`BL`-related issues with `Tutor`
which prevented us from testing.
Dante attributed this
to a poorly-crafted SQL query
which he has since fixed
(I believe).
Testing should resume today.

I hit a (minor?) snag
while packaging up
the SPARFA algorithms
into a python distribution package (library).
Because we want to keep the SPARFA code private,
we cannot use the `PyPI` distribution system
and it seems unlikely that we want to run our own.
This means we'll need to use git SHAs
instead of semantic versioning
to identify the code to install
in the `requirements.txt` file.
I _believe_ `pip`
(the program which install python dependencies)
can handle this,
but it needs to be confirmed and tested.

There isn't much else to report
due to the half-day on Fri
and the holiday on Mon.
