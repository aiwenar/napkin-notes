## AWS Autoscaling (proof-of-concept)

I've managed to get automatic autoscaling working.

There is an AWS CloudFormation template
that creates three autoscaling groups
(a request maker, a calculator, and a reporter)
and connects them to an RDS database.

The calculator instances
monitor the incoming request rate
and the calculation request backlog,
and launch/terminate instances accordingly.

Things that should still be done:
* adjusting the template for different repos
* adjusting the template for different branches/SHAs
* adjusting the template for different environments
* the templates can probably be simplified somewhat
* the templates should really be in a repo and not just in S3
* find the most effective way to monitor instance status/logs
* duplicate the test setup with a python application
* fill in the real SPARFA worker code

## AWS Aurora Clone Experiments

I still haven't done anything on this front,
but am pretty sure it'll work as advertised.
The Aurora Postgres feature
has been officially released,
so it is now possible
to test the clone feature
using Postgres instead of MySQL.
