## Biglearn API Experiment

Creating an autoscaling group (ASG) of Rails applications
behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) works.
We can even create separate ASGs
to handle different message types
(e.g., responses vs ecosystem updates)
and scale appropriately.

We can also assign subdomain URLs
(e.g., `scheduler.blah.bl.whatever.org`)
to the ELBs,
which makes it easier to manage secrets
for the various environments.
I still need to test this
using HTTPS certificates.

I didn't get the code
for BL API up and running this week
as I'd hoped.
Most of that was, I think,
my brain just hitting its limit
of AWS stuff this month.
I'll keep plugging away at it
over the holiday break (I hope).
