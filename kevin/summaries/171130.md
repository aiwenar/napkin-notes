## Class is done!

Yee-haw!  But I took a few vacation days around Thanksgiving so other things are a little behind.

## Biglearn Scheduler Experiment

I've started implementing an experiment
to measure the performance of my BL API/Scheduler designs
on the highest rate events and costliest queries
(the ones that are currently giving us trouble).

The schema work is done,
and I _belive_ all query issues have been worked out.
I'm reusing the autoscaling code
from previous experiments,
so now it should be pretty quick to get things up and running.
I expect to have initial results by Monday.

I'm actually looking forward 
to digging back into this...

## Amanda Transition

I've been chatting with Amanda from time to time
and exchanging technical details with her.
But she has mentioned the need 
for her to hand off what she's done
sometime in the near future.
