## New BL Autoscaling Document

(Linked above).
Over the break
I wrote up pretty much everything I could think of
related to the high-level understanding
of how BL should work.

There is a rough outline
of what the deploy scripts need to do,
but I'm sure devops and I will need to sit down
and hash out a bunch of details.

## Autoscaling BL API

I've started on this.
I'm currently updating the specs for the `Protocol` library
because I want to tweak its interface a little
before using it everywhere in BL API.
In the process,
I'm re-loading my rspec brain
and getting used to some of the new features
in the related testing libraries.
Context switching is painful,
especially when the tools
are evolving when you're not looking...

I think once I get cranking on the Rails server
things should move along reasonably quickly.
